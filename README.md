If you dislike the primary UI color, you can change the color by choosing the 'Change Color' item in the **View** menu-item. **(not stable/persistent yet)**

Overall, the Hyro app is a lightweight development tool that I made to make frontend testing faster and easier. It is not meant to be a complete supplement for Sublime Text and Vim, but if you use it for these purposes that's alright. Also, If you would like to raise an issue/bug or make a pull request, you are more than welcome to and I will do my best to help solve the problem.

Thank you and happy hacking.

# Development
Hyro is built with node-webkit and jquery.

### Todo 
* Coderunner plug-ins built in.
